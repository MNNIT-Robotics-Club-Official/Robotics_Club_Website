                    Robotics Club MNNIT is a student body under the Student Activity Centre (SAC), MNNIT Allahabad. 
                    We are a group of like-minded engineering students from all the college departments, 
                    and what unites us is our passion for technology, particularly robotics, automation, 
                    and artificial intelligence. 
                    We build robots for all sorts of applications, 
                    not only for competing at competitions but also to solve challenging real-life problems with technology. 
                    Since our club's establishment in 2016, we have completed <a href="{% url 'project:list' %}" target="_blank">50+ projects</a> in all domains related to robotics and automation, 
                    from design to circuits to software. We are also the birthplace of a fully functional startup, 
                    <a href="https://tsaw.tech/" target="_blank">TSAW</a>.

                    Technologies like robotics, automation, IoT, and artificial intelligence will be the workhorses of this decade. 
                    Many challenges are waiting to be solved with technology. 
                    In the past four years, since our club's establishment, we have gained expertise in all aspects of technology related to robotics and automation, 
                    notably <a href="{% url 'home:index' %}" target="_blank">these</a>.

                    If you feel you have any problem in these technologies' domain, our clubsâ€™ budding engineers 
                    are all ears for it. In our club, we believe that engineering should not happen after passing 
                    out from college, it should start right away from when one enters an engineering college. 
                    We offer you a workforce equipped with all tools to deal with challenges, and are eager to 
                    apply their knowledge to real-world problems. We are open to all potential partners who want 
                    to collaborate with us. Any collaborative projects from startups or companies from the industries 
                    in robotics and automation are most welcome. We assure you full professionalism and dedication 
                    from our end with anything you trust us.
