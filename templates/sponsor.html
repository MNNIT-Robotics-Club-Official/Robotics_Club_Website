                    Starting from a college club in 2016, we now want to expand way beyond it.
                </p>

                <p>In the coming years we aim to:</p>
                <div class="tab">
                    <p>1) <span style="font-weight: 700;">Tie-up</span> with industries and <span

                    </p>
                    <p>2) Emerge as a <span style="font-weight: 700;">center of excellence</span> in the field of
                        robotics, automation, and artificial
                        intelligence, by doing <span style="font-weight: 700;">cutting-edge research</span> in our club,
                        in both theoretical and practical

                    </p>
                    <p>3) Bring laurels to college and nation by participating not only in national but also

                <p>At Robotics Club MNNIT, we believe that donations are <span style="font-weight: 700;">not just</span>

                <p>Throughout the past, the club and its activities have helped hundreds, if not thousands, of budding
                    engineers, imparting onto them practical experience right from the day they enter college.</p>
                <p>However, as we now want to expand beyond college premises and work on real-world problems, <span

                    <p>1) To work with industry we need industry-level equipment. which is costly.
                    </p>
                    <p>2) Most robotics competitions need initial investment in the form of standard robots.</p>

                        will
                        help us a lot.
